initialGuess :: Int -> ([Card],GameState)
{-
For the first guess, when the list of possible answers is at its longest, you may want to
use a different approach. Given the way the feedback works, the best first guess would
be to choose two cards of different suits and with ranks about equally distant from each
other and from the top and bottom ranks. In general, for an n card answer, you should
choose ranks that are about 13/(n + 1) ranks apart.

todo
- cards
    the number of cards in 13/(2 + 1), so that would 6 which would select the
    6th element selected from the list, while the next selection would be 6 + 13 from the possible list

nextGuess :: ([Card],GameState) -> (Int,Int,Int,Int,Int) -> ([Card],GameState)
{-
    takes as input a pair of the previous guess and game state, and the feedback to this
    guess as a quintuple of counts of correct cards, low ranks, correct ranks, high ranks,
    and correct suits, and returns a pair of the next guess and new game state.

    - implement rulesets to filter out the 0s and the ns check

    - also make it ask the user for input out when its stuck
    - currently not returning a new guess out of the possibilities
    - add noHigher and noLower = 0 at the same time
    - add noHigher adn nolower = n then poss \\ ( filter islowerrank than the highest and ishigherank than the lowest )

    - needs to modify the filter function to accept list of lists

{-
takes a target and a guess (in that order), each represented as a list of Cards, and
returns the five feedback numbers, as explained above, as a tuple

1. How many of the cards in the answer are also in the guess (correct cards).
 - match strings

2. How many cards in the answer have rank lower than the lowest rank in the guess (lower
ranks). Ranks, in order from low to high, are 2â€“10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace.
 - pick the lowest rank from list 2 and see how many are lower than that

3. How many of the cards in the answer have the same rank as a card in the guess (correct
ranks). For this, each card in the guess is only counted once. That is, if the answer has
two queens and the guess has one, the correct ranks number would be 1, not 2. Likewise
if there is one queen in the answer and two in the guess.
- list comprehension , if a card is correct, ++1 and skip to the next one

4. How many cards in the answer have rank higher than the highest rank in the guess
(higher ranks).
5. How many of the cards in the answer have the same suit as a card in the guess, only
counting a card in the guess once (correct suits). For example, if the answer has two
clubs and the guess has one club, or vice versa, the correct suits number would be 1,
not 2.
